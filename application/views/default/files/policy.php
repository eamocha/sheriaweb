				<strong><span >We value security as much as you do</span></strong>
			</h3>
			<p >

That is why we follow a strict set of guidelines in order to keep all of your private information safe. Of course, this means that we will never sell, rent or share your private information with third parties.

			</h3>
			<p >
				<span>With SHERIA360 you are guaranteed 99.9% availability, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We make this possible by having redundant facilities and servers in place at all times.

				<span>Furthermore, we constantly expand our server facilities in order to keep up with customer growth, which makes it possible for our system to always be ready to handle the increasing number of users.</span>
